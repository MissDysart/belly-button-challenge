Datta Analytics Bootcamp - Module 14 Challenge: Interactive Visualizations

### Objectives
1. Initialize all visualizations (bar chart, bubble chart and Metadata card) without error. 
2. Update all visualizations when a new sample is selected.
3. Deploy app to Github Pages.

### Notes
1. All objectives met even though my code could be more concise.
2. The index.html was edited to remove `onchange="optionChanged(this.value)"` because it was throwing an error when different samples were selected.
3. Did not attempt the optional advanced part of the challenge.
